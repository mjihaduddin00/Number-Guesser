# Number-Guesser

This is my project submission where I was tasked to create a number guessing game that uses the end-client's inputted value against the computer's randomly generated value and determine which number is closest to the target value randomly generated and assigned. This application utilizes HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

Thanks!
